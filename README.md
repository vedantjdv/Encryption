# Encryption
This code provides implementation of AES encryption and decryption using a provided encryption key. It encrypts sensitive data by converting it to bytes, encrypting the bytes using AES, and returning the encrypted data as a Base64-encoded string. Similarly, it decrypts the encrypted data by decoding it, decrypting the bytes, and returning the decrypted data as a String.
